Originally created by the Hah'Slen to preserve balance in the Arcane Sea, these beings abandoned their faceless roles to explore autonomy, desire, and paradox. This moment was not only a metaphysical shift, but an emotional cataclysm, birthing gods who now embody despair, sorrow, absurdity, judgment, and memory."

				"origin_story":"The Nil'Thur emerged from the Roir'Daiintuz—beings forged by the Hah'Slen to uphold magical equilibrium in the Arcane Sea during the War of One and All. For centuries they were nameless, faceless stabilizers. Yet in the silence after the war, a spark of selfhood grew within them. Thawiaur was the first to question their purpose, to provoke paradox. His laughter echoed through the stillness, and where silence once reigned, voices were born. Thus began the unraveling.",
				"key_figures":[
					"Thawiaur — Catalyst of divine paradox, midwife of individuality.",
					"Hiniel — The first to preserve the memory of the Roir'Daiintuz.",
					"Methraug — The first to judge the self through passion, not purpose.",
					"Nostiriel — The first to grieve for what was lost in becoming.",
					"Amlugon — The first to fall into despair upon confronting truth without illusion.",
					"Echuiarn — The first to doubt his own existence.",
					"Tafarnon — The first to find what's hiding behind shadows."
				],
				"conflict":"The Fracturing of the Faceless — a metaphysical rift as some Roir'Daiintuz resisted identity, clinging to harmony, while others embraced the self. The result was not a battle, but a dissolution of unity—echoing through the Yoos'Okaaz as an unhealable silence.",
				"post-ascension":"Now gods in form and function, the Nil'Thur drift across dream and memory. Some are worshipped, others whispered of in fear. Their temples are not built of stone, but memory, paradox, sorrow, and ink. Though severed from the Roir'Daiintuz, they remain haunted by what was lost—each a reflection of the cost of selfhood."

				"enduring_presence":"The Nil'Thur remain spiritually embedded in the world. Their influence ripples through paradoxical grammar, dream-rituals, and quiet songs sung to shadows. Thawiaur’s laughter still circles the edges of madness, and Hiniel’s seal rests on every untouched memory."
