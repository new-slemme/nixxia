By every scale on my hide, there is no creature alive that makes my crest flare faster than a wyrm in full motion. People keep calling them “lesser dragons” or “sky-serpents gone wrong” and I want to bite the next fool who says it within earshot. They are NOT dragons. They never were. They are something fiercer, something leaner, something that looked at a world with no more fire-lords in the clouds and said “Fine. We’ll do it ourselves, teeth first.”[/p]\r\n[p]Wyrms are the undisputed apex stalkers of half the continents and most of the deep sea. From the tiniest cliff-flitter (barely a metre snout-to-tail and lighter than a fat house-cat) to the monstrous old Voidserpents of Lotkrosis that can swallow a reef-cutter whole, every single one shares the same brutal, beautiful blueprint: four limbs only, two powerful hind legs and a pair of wings that double as forelimbs. No arms, no cheating with extra claws. Just hind legs, wings, tail, and attitude enough to make a thunder-wyrm jealous.[/p]\r\n[p]Three great broods split the world between them:[/p]\r\n[ul]\r\n- [b]Nehylkaadov[/b] – the sky-raiders, the cliff-divers, the ones that fold their wings and fall like thrown spears.\r\n- [b]Zemodov[/b] – the earth-shakers, the living landslides, the ones that taught stone what patience looks like.\r\n- [b]Nigirdov[/b] – the deep hunters, the ones that make Zaetaedhel sirens go quiet when they speak of “the shadows that have teeth on both sides.”\r\n[/ul]\r\n[p]Every brood, every species, every colour and crest and venomous tail-spike is its own masterpiece of stubborn survival. Some spit fire hot enough to melt bronze (Ghostbacks, I’m looking at you). Some exhale frost that flash-freezes blood in the veins. Some just bite you in half and call it breakfast. All of them are built to last in a world that tried very hard to forget how to make anything that magnificent.[/p]\r\n[p]If you ever see one glide overhead and your first thought is “dragon”, do me a favour: slap yourself with your own tail. Dragons are fairy tales for hatchlings. Wyrms are what actually still hunts under Narumar’s red eye.[/p]\r\n[p]And trust me, I’ve measured the teeth marks to prove it.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]",

    "anatomy": "[p][i]By Zesik Medeswasit, Kugizostuz of the Living Catalogue[/i][/p]\r\n[p][i]Date: 12549 MV, written in a cave on the Revakgol Spine after helping a stranded juvenile Ghostback back into the air (note to self: wing joints are stronger than my pride)[/i][/p]\r\n[p]Right, claws on the tablet, crest down, let’s talk bones and meat.[/p]\r\n[p]Every wyrm, from the metre-long cliff-flitters to the reef-cracking grandmothers of Lotkrosis, is built on the same unbreakable rule: [b]four limbs, no more, no less.[/b] Two thick hind legs for pushing, leaping, climbing, or swimming like a crocodile on a mission. The front half of the body is carried by the wings themselves (yes, the wings ARE the forelimbs). No cheating with little grabby arms. The shoulder girdle is a masterpiece of living engineering: massive scapulae, elongated “arm” bones that become the primary wing spar, and a single enormous finger (the wing-finger) that stretches the whole membrane. At the bend of the wing lives one honest-to-Nostiriel claw (sharp enough to gut a bull auroch if the wyrm folds its wing just right).[/p]\r\n[p]The spine is a long, flexible whip of seventy-to-ninety vertebrae (I counted on a dead one once; don’t ask). It lets them coil like a spring, lash the tail like a war-flail, or flatten belly-to-ground when they want to disappear against rock. Tail length is usually 1.2–1.5 times the body; it’s pure muscle wrapped around a core of cartilage rings, ending in a tapered blade or spade depending on brood.[/p]\r\n[p]Scales are overlapping scutes of keratin-reinforced dermal bone. Thinner and more flexible than people think (you can dent one with a good war-pick, ask me how I know), but layered so densely that only the biggest predators ever get through to meat. Underneath sits a lattice of chain-mail-like mesh that turns blade edges. Nehylkaadov have lighter, keeled scales for speed in the air; Zemodov pack on granite-thick osteoderms that sometimes fuse into proper armour plates; Nigirdov go sleek and hydrodynamic, with scales that slide over each other like river stones.[/p]\r\n[p]Musculature is ridiculous. The hind legs carry pectoral-style slabs that would make an Ogim blacksmith weep with envy. Flight muscles (anchored to that enormous keel bone sticking down from the sternum) are the single largest muscle group in Nehylkaadov; in Zemodov the same tissue bulk has migrated to the shoulders and back for digging and crushing. Nigirdov turned it into one long rippling sheet that runs from neck to tail-tip for that endless side-to-side serpent swim.[/p]\r\n[p]Sexual dimorphism shows up in proportion, not decoration. Females average 15–25 % longer and heavier, with broader pelvic girdles for egg-laying and slightly longer tails for balance when gravid. Males tend to have proportionally larger wing surface (sometimes comically so in cliff species) and thicker neck musculature for display and combat.[/p]\r\n[p]Skeleton is light for its strength (hollow bones laced with arcane calcium, the same stuff that makes wyrm-bone arrows fly truer than steel). Break one open and you’ll still smell faint ozone; nobody knows why, but the smiths pay triple for unbroken marrow bones.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]",
    "perception": "[p][i]By Zesik Medeswasit, Kugizostuz of the Living Catalogue[/i][/p]\r\n[p][i]Date: 12544 MV, written half-deaf inside a thunder-cave on the Strunmah Ridge after a Ghostback decided my notebook looked tasty[/i][/p]\r\n[p]If wyrms ruled the world, it would be because nothing else gets to hide from them. Ever.[/p]\r\n[p][b]Vision[/b] Eyes the size of my fist on the big ones, and they miss nothing. Full colour vision (better blues and violets than any Zegtuzsos I know), plus a tapetum that turns their stare into twin lanterns at night. Nehylkaadov can spot a rabbit’s ear twitch from three kilometres up. I tested it. Twice. The second time the rabbit was me.[/p]\r\n[p][b]Hearing[/b] Ear holes are just slits behind the jaw hinge, but the inner ear is a miracle. They hear the wing-beat of a moth at fifty metres and the heartbeat of something hiding under two metres of stone. Infrasound, too; old Zemodov matriarchs feel approaching avalanches or dragon-quakes (yes, I said dragon-quakes, shut up) hours before the ground even thinks about moving. When Narumar is full and red, every wyrm on the continent gets twitchy because they can hear the moon’s tides in their bones.[/p]\r\n[p][b]Smell & Taste[/b] Nostrils for air-scenting, tongue for everything else. That forked tongue flicks once and they know what you had for breakfast three days ago, how scared you are right now, and whether your sister is in season two valleys over. Vomeronasal organ so sharp I’ve seen a blind Nigirdov follow a single drop of blood through a kelp forest the size of a city.[/p]\r\n[p][b]Vibration & Substrate Sensing[/b] Jaws rest on the ground when they’re “just sitting.” They’re not resting; they’re listening through stone. Zemodov feel footfalls half a kilometre away. Nigirdov feel the pressure wave of a whale calf being born on the other side of a trench. Try sneaking up on one. Go on. I’ll wait here with the bandages.[/p]\r\n[p][b]Echolocation (Nigirdov only)[/b] Deep-water broods click and hiss in sequences too fast for my ear. They come back with a perfect 3-D map of caves, wrecks, and anything stupid enough to hold still. I once heard a Voidserpent “sing” a reef into view from four hundred metres down; sounded like a broken harp strung with nightmares.[/p]\r\n[p][b]Heat Pits (certain Zemodov and high-altitude Nehylkaadov)[/b] Small pits between nostril and eye, loreal-style. Sensitive enough to see a warm-blooded creature in total darkness or through thin rock. The Irudy Glassfangs use them to find Ogim caravans under sand dunes. Never travel the deep desert without cold-iron armour. Just don’t.[/p]\r\n[p][b]Arcane Sensitivity / Instinctive Tazri Resonance[/b] Here’s where my crest really stands up. Some bloodlines, Ghostbacks, Hellkites, certain Frostcrest clans, feel Tazri the way I feel excitement. Not learned magic; raw, ancestral reflex. They taste ley-lines like blood in the water. When a Ghostback lines up a dive and the air suddenly smells of ozone, run. The fire or frost isn’t coming from a gland; it’s the world itself answering their hunger. I’ve seen a Hellkite exhale a thirty-metre cone of flame that left glass craters and not one scale singed. Still don’t know how. Still want to hug one and ask.[/p]\r\n[p]Put all of that together and you’re never the hunter. You’re the thing that hasn’t been noticed yet.[/p]\r\n[p]I’ve lost three assistants and half my tail-tip learning this section. Worth it.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]\r\n[p][/p]",

The head is long, narrow, and built like a spear-head wrapped in living armour; never the blunt wedge of a true crocodile, never the regal wedge of the old sky-tyrant tales. It is a hunting tool first, a display second, and a nightmare every moment in between.[/p]\r\n[p][b]Skull & Jaw[/b] The snout tapers to a blunt, slightly downturned point (perfect for punching through water or pinning prey to stone). Jaws are long and lined with 60–90 backward-curving, serrated teeth that replace themselves every 80–120 days. The bite is a shearing trap, not a crushing one; they slice chunks off rather than grind bone. Lower jaw has a flexible symphysis so the mouth can open absurdly wide (I once watched a 9-metre Nigirdov unhinge and swallow a reef-cutter in one gulp; my crest is still stuck upright thinking about it).[/p]\r\n[p][b]Eyes[/b] Forward-facing, large, and protected by a thick nictitating membrane plus a bony brow ridge. The iris is a vertical slit in most broods, glowing amber, emerald, or ice-white in darkness because of a mirror-bright tapetum. Nehylkaadov have the biggest eyes (better for spotting goats from two kilometres up); Nigirdov shrink them to pinpricks and add a second clear eyelid for deep-water pressure.[/p]\r\n[p][b]Nostrils & Breathing[/b] Two slit-like nostrils high on the snout, edged with muscular flaps that seal watertight. Zemodov and high-altitude Nehylkaadov can close them completely when burrowing or diving through ash clouds. Exhale through the mouth if they want to look threatening (hot breath, steam, or, in the lucky ones, actual fire).[/p]\r\n[p][b]Tongue & Vomeronasal Organ[/b] Long (up to 70 cm in adults), forked, and bright pink or black depending on brood. Constantly flicking, tasting air and water. The tips are so sensitive I’ve seen a blind old Ghostback track a wounded goat across bare rock just by tongue-flicking the blood trail.[/p]\r\n[p][b]Horns, Crests & Frills[/b] Here’s where personality shows. Horns are keratin, not bone, and grow continuously (worn down by fighting or scraping).[/p]\r\n[ul]\r\n- Nehylkaadov: swept-back horns or a single nasal spike for cutting wind.\r\n- Zemodov: thick, forward-curving rams-horns or ridged bony plates that can butt a hole through basalt.\r\n- Nigirdov: often no horns at all, but spectacular fin-crests or glowing lures that trail behind the head like living banners. Some species (looking at you, Hjemland Frostcrest) grow branching antler-like racks that shed and regrow every few decades. Scars on the face are common; a clean snout just means they haven’t lived enough.\r\n[/ul]\r\n[p][b]Throat & Dewlap[/b] Many have a stretchy gular pouch under the jaw (bright red, cobalt, or corpse-white) that inflates during threat displays or mating. In fire-breathing individuals the throat glows dull orange just before they spit (fair warning if you’re stupid enough to stand in front).[/p]\r\n[p]Put it all together and you get a face that is pure predatory focus: sleek, scarred, expressive in ways that don’t need a smile. One slow blink from those glowing eyes and you already know whose continent this is.[/p]\r\n[p]I still have the tooth-mark scar on my left snout ridge from the day I tried to measure a Nigirdov matriarch’s jaw gape. Worth it. KRIF! Face like that could haunt dreams and start religions. Usually does both.[/p]\r\n[p]Next page before she comes back for the other side of my face.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]\r\n[p][/p]",

    "socialstructure": "[p][i]By Zesik Medeswasit, Kugizostuz of the Living Catalogue[/i][/p]\r\n[p][i]Date: 12550 MV (same day), added after watching that same Zemodov bull ignore a rival’s scent-mark like it wasn’t even there[/i][/p]\r\n[p]Wyrms aren’t pack beasts. No herds, no clans, no chittering family trees like us Zegtuzsos. Solitary is the rule, with territories stretching 50–200 square kilometres depending on brood and prey density. A single adult claims a cliff-face, burrow-network, or reef-section and defends it with everything short of breath-weapon overkill.[/p]\r\n[p]Temporary aggregations happen, though—wundun moments! During rich feeding seasons (like Zuzil salmon runs for Nigirdov or Daazil migrations for Nehylkaadov), a dozen might share a kill-site without bloodshed. Dominance displays rule these: wing-spreads, horn-locks, tail-thrashes until the biggest eats first. No lasting hierarchies; it’s all posturing for the meal.[/p]\r\n[p]Mother-offspring bonds last 2–5 years. Hatchlings stick close, learning hunts by mimicry. Females teach gliding or burrowing basics, then boot them out when they hit sub-adult size. No true packs or herds ever form—closest is loose kin-groups recognising each other by scent (musk glands under the jaw leave unique chemical signatures). Siblings might tolerate shared borders, but that’s it.[/p]\r\n[p]Absence of herds means no leaders, no exiles, no politics. Just lone hunters who sometimes pause the solitude when the world offers plenty.[/p]\r\n[p]Saw three Nigirdov share a whale carcass once off Uruvaril. No fights, just efficient tearing. Then gone like shadows. Pure poetry in scales.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]\r\n[p][/p]",

    "behaviour": "[p][i]By Zesik Medeswasit, Kugizostuz of the Living Catalogue[/i][/p]\r\n[p][i]Date: 12550 MV, scratched into a fresh moonbone slab after a full day trailing a Zemodov bull through the ash-plains (he knew I was there the whole time; just didn’t care)[/i][/p]\r\n[p]Wyrms don’t think like us. They don’t brood on philosophy or plot revenge across decades. But don’t mistake that for stupid. Their psychology is a razor: simple, sharp, and always cutting toward survival.[/p]\r\n[p]Temperament is brood-deep. Nehylkaadov are twitchy aerial opportunists, always scanning horizons with that predator curiosity—spot something new, dive first, ask questions with teeth. Zemodov are patient ambushes personified; they’ll lie still for days under sand or snow, only exploding when prey commits. Nigirdov are cold calculators, shadowing schools of fish for hours before the strike, but they’ll turn playful in warm currents, chasing bubbles like oversized pups.[/p]\r\n[p]Territorial marking is scent and scar: urine sprays laced with musk that lingers for weeks, plus deep gouges in rock or tree with wing-claws or horns. Cross a line and you get the threat display—throat pouch inflating, crest flaring, low infrasonic rumble that shakes your guts. Mating rituals kick off with those same displays; males circle, flare wings to maximum span, and bellow until the female either charges or submits. Winners get the prize; losers slink off with fresh scars.[/p]\r\n[p]Reaction to us sentients varies. Most avoid big groups (smart), but lone travellers get stalked out of curiosity—especially if you smell interesting. I’ve had young Ghostbacks circle my camp for hours, tilting heads like they’re sizing up whether I’m food or fun. Avoidance is default for adults; curiosity peaks in juveniles. Grief or injury? They don’t mourn like we do, but a wounded wyrm will retreat to a den, lick wounds obsessively, and emerge meaner. Rare cooperative hunts happen when prey is massive—two or three kin sharing a kill, no fuss, then back to solitude.[/p]\r\n[p]In the end, wyrms are driven by hunger, territory, and that raw spark of wonder at anything that moves funny. Underestimate it and you’re lunch.[/p]\r\n[p]I once stared down a Hellkite for a solid hour. He blinked first.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]\r\n[p][/p]",
