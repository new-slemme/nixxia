During the warmer months, it engages in migratory flights to different coastal areas to mate and lay eggs. This migration ensures genetic diversity and allows the species to take advantage of varying fish populations throughout the year. As the weather cools, the Beaked Finneck returns to its primary hunting grounds, where the abundance of fish provides a stable food source. During winter, the creature becomes less active, conserving energy as the fish populations dwindle. This period of reduced activity also serves as a time for molting, where the Beaked Finneck sheds and regrows its fins to maintain their functionality. The seasonal migrations and cyclical behavior of the Beaked Finneck are vital for its survival and the health of the coastal ecosystems it inhabits.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "growthrate": "The Beaked Finneck experiences rapid growth in its early stages of life. Hatchlings, measuring about 1 meter in length, double in size within the first six months as they consume a protein-rich diet of small fish. By the end of their first year, they reach approximately 4 meters in length and begin to develop their distinctive purple fins. The juvenile stage lasts until they are about 3 years old, during which time they continue to grow at a steady pace, reaching their full adult length of 13 meters by the age of 5. The transition from juvenile to adult is marked by the development of their full wing span and the ability to undertake long migratory flights. The Beaked Finneck has a lifespan of around 50 years, with older individuals showing signs of wear on their fins and beak, though they remain agile and capable hunters throughout their lives.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "symbiotic": "The Beaked Finneck's nesting sites often attract smaller bird species that benefit from the protection provided by the larger creature's presence. However, it is also susceptible to parasites such as marine lice, which attach to its skin and fins.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
