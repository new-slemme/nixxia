    "lifespan": "15 years",
    "anatomy": "The Moon Dragon exhibits a compact yet sturdy build, with a slightly bulky frame compared to its larger wyrm relatives. Its scales are adorned in a striking shade of deep blue, reflecting the moonlight in the dense jungle canopy. The wings of the Moon Dragon, though small in comparison to other winged wyrms, are perfectly proportioned to its size, featuring delicate membranes that shimmer with an ethereal glow when touched by moonbeams. It has four limbs: two strong hind legs for grasping branches and two forelimbs that support its wing membranes. Its skeletal structure is lightweight but robust, allowing for agile flight and swift maneuvers through dense foliage.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "perception": "The Moon Dragon has highly developed senses suited to its nocturnal lifestyle. It possesses exceptional night vision, allowing it to see clearly in low-light conditions. Its sense of smell is acute, enabling it to detect the faintest scent of prey. Additionally, the Moon Dragon can sense vibrations through its feet, which helps it detect movements in its environment, a crucial adaptation for avoiding predators and locating prey.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "genetics": "Moon Dragons reproduce sexually with distinct male and female individuals. Breeding occurs once a year, during the peak of the moonlight cycle. Females lay clutches of 3-5 eggs in well-hidden nests within the foliage. The eggs hatch after a gestation period of approximately two weeks. Hatchlings are independent from birth but remain close to their birthplace for the first few weeks.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "ecology": "The Moon Dragon thrives in the upper canopy of the jungle, where it blends seamlessly with the blue-hued foliage. Its presence is vital for controlling insect populations, making it a keystone species in its ecosystem. Moon Dragons are territorial and prefer areas with ample moonlight, which supports their nocturnal hunting activities.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "diet": "As insectivores, Moon Dragons primarily feed on flying insects, which they catch mid-flight using their agile wings and sharp reflexes. They also consume smaller critters found on leaves. Their diet includes moths, beetles, and other nocturnal insects. Moon Dragons are opportunistic feeders, taking advantage of swarms and seasonal insect abundance.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "domestication": null,
    "uses": null,
    "biocycle": "Moon Dragons are most active during the full moon phases, when their scales absorb and reflect the moonlight most effectively. They undergo a period of reduced activity during the new moon, conserving energy and relying on stored fat reserves. Seasonal changes do not significantly affect their behavior, as the jungle environment remains relatively constant year-round.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "growthrate": "Moon Dragons grow rapidly in the first month of life, reaching full size within three months. They go through three distinct growth stages: hatchling, juvenile, and adult. Hatchlings are more vulnerable and spend most of their time hidden, juveniles begin exploring and hunting, and adults establish territories and breeding rights.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "symbiotic": "Moon Dragons share a symbiotic relationship with certain bioluminescent fungi, which help attract insects to their territory. They may also be host to tiny parasitic mites, though these typically do not cause significant harm.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "isSentient": false,
    "isIntelligent": false,
    "geographicalOrigin": "The Moon Dragon is endemic to the dense jungles of Siniath, predominantly found in the upper canopy layer. These jungles provide the perfect environment, with ample insect prey and thick foliage for cover. Moon Dragons are non-migratory, but they establish territories within their preferred trees and are known to inhabit areas with abundant moonlight exposure.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "averageIntelligence": "Moon Dragons are considered highly intelligent for their size. They display problem-solving abilities, such as finding hidden prey and avoiding predators. Their keen memory allows them to navigate the dense jungle efficiently and remember safe roosting spots.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "averagePhysique": "Moon Dragons possess a lithe and agile physique, allowing for swift and precise movements. Their muscles are well-developed for flight, and their lightweight skeletal structure supports their aerial agility.",
    "facialCharacteristics": "The face of a Moon Dragon is adorned with small, gem-like eyes that shimmer in the moonlight, providing excellent night vision. They have a short snout with fine, sensory hairs that help detect minute vibrations. Their mouth houses sharp, tiny teeth perfect for gripping and consuming insects.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "skinHairColor": "Moon Dragons are characterized by their deep blue scales, which reflect moonlight and help them blend into their surroundings. Their scales may have slight variations in hue, creating a pattern that aids in camouflage. Males often display brighter and more iridescent scales during the breeding season.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "traits": "Males tend to have slightly brighter coloration and longer tail fins compared to females, which are more muted in color.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
