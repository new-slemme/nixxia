    "lifespan": "55 years (males); 65 years (females)",
    "anatomy": "The Coastal Drake has a sleek, streamlined body adapted for life along the shores. It features four powerful limbs with webbed claws, aiding in both swimming and grasping slippery prey. Its muscular wings, though not as expansive as those of traditional dragons, are highly efficient for agile flight and swift gliding above water. The skeletal structure of the Coastal Drake is light yet strong, providing the necessary support for both aerial and aquatic activities. The tail is long and flexible, serving as a crucial balance and steering mechanism during flight and swimming.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "perception": "Coastal Drakes have exceptional sensory capabilities. Their keen eyesight allows them to spot fish schools from great heights, while their hearing is finely tuned to detect the subtle sounds of prey and potential threats. They possess specialized sensory pits along their jaws, capable of detecting vibrations in the water, enhancing their hunting efficiency. Additionally, their nostrils can expel excess salt, allowing them to extract freshwater from their prey, an adaptation crucial for their coastal habitat.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "genetics": "Coastal Drakes reproduce sexually, with mating pairs engaging in elaborate courtship displays during the breeding season. Females lay clutches of up to three eggs in secure nests constructed along rocky cliffs. The gestation period for the eggs is approximately 60 days, after which the hatchlings emerge, already capable of rudimentary flight and swimming. Parental care is shared, with both parents protecting and nurturing the young until they are independent, usually after one year.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "ecology": "The optimal environment for Coastal Drakes includes rocky cliffs, sandy shores, and abundant marine life. They are highly adaptable, capable of thriving in both temperate and tropical coastal regions. Their interactions with the environment include hunting for fish, basking on sunlit rocks to regulate body temperature, and nesting on cliffs to avoid terrestrial predators. Coastal Drakes play a crucial role in the coastal ecosystem, helping control fish populations and maintaining the balance of marine life.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "diet": "Primarily piscivores, Coastal Drakes rely on their keen eyesight and agile flight to hunt schools of fish. They are known for their spectacular diving techniques, plunging into the sea to catch prey with precision. Coastal Drakes consume a variety of fish species and occasionally supplement their diet with crustaceans and small marine mammals. They typically hunt during dawn and dusk when fish are most active near the surface.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "domestication": null,
    "uses": null,
    "biocycle": "Coastal Drakes' biological cycles are influenced by the seasons. They are more active during warmer months, engaging in hunting and social behaviors. In colder seasons, they reduce their activity levels, relying on stored fat reserves. Breeding typically occurs in the spring, aligning with the abundance of food resources. Their molting cycle also aligns with seasonal changes, with molts occurring in late spring and early autumn.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "growthrate": "Coastal Drakes experience rapid growth during their first year, doubling in size within the first six months. They reach sexual maturity by the age of five, at which point their growth rate slows significantly. Throughout their life, they undergo periodic molting, shedding old scales to accommodate new growth. The stages of their life include hatchling, juvenile, sub-adult, and adult, each with distinct physical and behavioral characteristics.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "symbiotic": "Coastal Drakes maintain a symbiotic relationship with small, aquatic birds that clean their scales of parasites. However, they are also susceptible to marine parasites that attach to their underbelly, which they often rid themselves of by basking on sunlit rocks.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "isSentient": false,
    "isIntelligent": false,
    "geographicalOrigin": "Originating from the coastal regions of Nixxia, the Coastal Drake is predominantly found along the shores of Siniath and Irudy. These areas provide the ideal environment with their rocky cliffs, sandy beaches, and abundant marine life. Over time, Coastal Drakes have adapted to a wide range of coastal habitats, from temperate to tropical climates. Their range extends several kilometers inland during breeding seasons, where they seek out secure nesting sites.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "averageIntelligence": "The Coastal Drake exhibits a high level of intelligence among reptilian species, comparable to that of dolphins and some primates. They demonstrate problem-solving abilities, particularly in hunting strategies and navigating complex coastal terrains. Coastal Drakes also exhibit a strong memory, remembering migratory patterns of fish schools and optimal hunting grounds.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "averagePhysique": "Coastal Drakes have a streamlined physique, optimized for agility and speed. Their muscular structure supports powerful bursts of movement both in the air and in water, essential for their piscivorous lifestyle.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "facialCharacteristics": "Coastal Drakes possess a distinctive facial structure characterized by a long, tapered snout and prominent brow ridges. Their eyes, set slightly forward, provide binocular vision, crucial for depth perception during hunting dives. The coloration around their eyes often intensifies during the mating season, adding to their visual appeal. They have a series of small, sensory pits along their jaws, aiding in detecting vibrations in the water.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
    "skinHairColor": "The Coastal Drake's body is adorned with a vibrant gradient of colors. The upper body features a striking red hue, while the underbelly fades to a deep green. This coloration not only serves as camouflage but also plays a role in social interactions and mating displays.\r\n[br]\r\n[br]",
