    "content": "[p]The [b]Lokraasos[/b] (/ˈloʊk.rɑː.sɔs/), a rare and sacred subspecies of the Saarotsos, are known among dragonkin as the [i]Skylords[/i], the [i]Veined-Winged[/i], and the [i]Daughters of the High Flame[/i]. Towering nearly 1.9 meters tall and stretching close to 2.7 meters from crown to tail, they are born only as daughters — never sons — and never in pairs. Each is a singular event, a breath of the divine cast into flesh and scale.[/p]\r\n[p]From the moment their leathery wings unfurl — spanning eight meters tip to tip, veined with flame-fed blood — the world around them changes. The air grows still. Speech falters. Even the Saarotsos, proud children of fire, bow their heads. Not from law or fear, but from something older: reverence, awe, the unshakable instinct that one is in the presence of what was [i]meant[/i] to rise.[/p]\r\n[p]Their skin is dark and metallic, like bronze sunk in shadow. Their limbs are lithe, but forged in strength. Eyes burn with an inner heat, casting firelight on stone and soul alike. Their hair, if it may be called such, moves of its own accord — prehensile and strange, as though it listens to things others cannot hear. Their wings are not for ornament or ceremony. They are muscle and breath and purpose, the sky-wrought inheritance of a people once closer to gods than to earth.[/p]\r\n[p]They are born few and far between. No one chooses to become Lokraasos. No rite awakens them, no lineage ensures them. They simply are. In every generation, perhaps one is born. Perhaps none. But when they do come, their arrival is marked by silence, by flame, by visions and unsettled winds. They are not rulers, yet their counsel is heeded across the Revakgol Empire. They are not commanders, yet armies have marched because they [i]watched[/i]. They are not gods — but there are those who kneel.[/p]\r\n[p]Among the Saarotsos, the Lokraasos stand not above, but apart. They speak when the sky speaks. They strike when the flame demands. And when they take to the air, the earth remembers the dragons of old — and trembles.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]",

    "lifespan": "180 years",
    "anatomy": "[p]Lokraasos are bipedal and hexalimbic, bearing six fully developed limbs: two powerful legs, two muscled arms, and a pair of vast membranous wings. Their average height stands at 1.9 meters, but the addition of their tail brings their full length closer to 2.7 meters. Their wings, stretching up to eight meters wide, are supported by an advanced skeletal arch fused to the scapulae and reinforced by internal ridging — a structure evolved for prolonged flight and sudden aerial maneuvering.[/p]\r\n[p]Their musculature is dense but elegant, built for sustained speed and agility rather than brute force. Pectoral and dorsal muscles around the shoulder girdle are especially developed to anchor flight motion. Their legs are digitigrade and end in clawed feet — talons that grip stone and ash alike with unshakable hold. The tail is both flexible and prehensile, used for counterbalance mid-flight, rapid changes in direction, or close-quarters combat.[/p]\r\n[p]Lokraasos possess an internal skeleton reinforced by high-density bone marrow and chitinous plate overlays across vital regions. Their dermis is armored in metallic-black scales with a slight iridescent sheen, capable of deflecting small arms and mitigating environmental exposure. Beneath the skin, an auxiliary network of blood vessels supports the wings’ metabolic demands, feeding oxygen and flame-tinged plasma through radiant, veined membranes.[/p]\r\n[p]Each hand bears four elongated fingers tipped with talon-like nails, and their grasp is both strong and unnervingly precise. Their eyes, wide and slightly slanted, are adapted for low-light and high-altitude vision, possessing a nictitating membrane to guard against aerial debris and solar glare. Hearing is similarly refined, with recessed ear structures that filter turbulence and orient to distant cries across vast distances.[/p]\r\n[p]Hair grows in serpentine strands down the crown and nape, often prehensile and subtly reactive to air currents, pressure changes, or emotion. These filaments are thought to assist in mid-flight balance and interpersonal communication through subtle undulations.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]",
    "perception": "[p]Lokraasos possess a sensory suite that borders on the supernatural — finely attuned to the high skies and liminal spaces they inhabit. Their vision is unparalleled, adapted to both broad panoramic sweeps and acute focal tracking. They can spot movement across leagues of open air, read thermal eddies, and perceive the subtle glimmer of magical residue as a flicker in the air or a bruise upon the horizon.[/p]\r\n[p]Their pupils contract to vertical slits, protecting against solar glare at altitude, while a second, translucent eyelid shields their eyes during high-speed flight. In darkness, their eyes glow softly, and in silence, they see what others would miss — the tremor of breath in a creature’s lungs, the twitch of thought behind a still face.[/p]\r\n[p]Their hearing is likewise sharpened, capable of discerning the faintest wingbeat or whispered prayer from vast distances. Ears are recessed and shielded beneath scale, tuned not only to mundane sound but to tonal changes in the wind itself — detecting pressure shifts, distant clashes, or the slow gathering of storm.[/p]\r\n[p]Their sense of smell is acute, honed for atmospheric sampling. Scents are mapped across memory like glyphs across stone — a Lokraasos can distinguish not only the scent of blood but whether it carries fear, rage, or something [i]other[/i]. Their tongue and palate are similarly sensitive, capable of detecting arcane volatility or poisons long before they manifest.[/p]\r\n[p]More mysterious still is their [i]Koric resonance[/i]. Even among Saarotsos, the Lokraasos are uniquely sensitive to the stirrings of Kori in others. They feel it as warmth behind the sternum, as pressure in the wings, as rhythm through stone. Though not truly telepathic, they [i]perceive[/i] emotion and will through this internal barometer — able to sense lies, hesitation, or unspoken desire through sympathetic reaction.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]",
    "genetics": "[p]Lokraasos are born, not bred. They emerge spontaneously — always female, always alone — from Saarotsos clutches where no such outcome was expected. Their appearance is not inherited or planned, but believed to be ordained. Despite millennia of study and speculation, no pairing has ever reliably produced a Lokraasos. Their births are seen as divine interruption rather than biological progression.[/p]\r\n[p]A Lokraasos develops from a fertilized Saarotsos egg under circumstances still not fully understood, though many believe the state of the mother’s Kori, celestial alignments, or ancient bloodrites may influence the transformation. When a Lokraasos is carried, the egg itself undergoes marked changes: its shell darkens, emits heat, and pulses faintly with light as the growing embryo draws deeper from the Flame Within.[/p]\r\n[p]Incubation typically lasts longer than a standard Saarotsos gestation — up to ten months — during which time the mother often experiences heightened Koric resonance and vivid prophetic dreams. Once born, the Lokraasos grows at a similar rate to their Saarotsos kin, but her wings begin to unfurl within weeks, and her Koric flame burns with a clarity rarely seen even in seasoned warriors.[/p]\r\n[p]Because they are born singly and always female, Lokraasos cannot reproduce their kind. No Lokraasos has ever laid an egg. Their legacy is not continued through blood, but through myth, vision, and memory. They do not found houses or dynasties — they found legends.[/p]\r\n[p]Though their genetics are indistinguishable from the Saarotsos in many key aspects, something in them diverges — perhaps in their Kori, perhaps in their soul — and that difference is enough to change the sky above them. Where others are born of lineage, the Lokraasos are born of flame and fate.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]\r\n[p][/p]",

    "growthrate": "[p]Lokraasos hatch small, nearly indistinguishable from Saarotsos young save for the dark luster of their scale and the faint heat that radiates from beneath their skin. During the first year, their growth is swift. Wing-bones stretch rapidly, and a secondary vascular network — essential for flight — establishes itself across the back and spine. By the end of their second year, most Lokraasos can lift themselves into brief glides, though sustained flight remains beyond reach.[/p]\r\n[p]Between the ages of 3 and 10, their skeletal and muscular systems mature significantly. The bones hollow slightly to reduce weight, while sinew, cartilage, and scale thicken along the limbs and chest. By age 10, most can fly short distances with control. Their tails lengthen and stabilize, and their iconic prehensile hair becomes increasingly mobile and expressive.[/p]\r\n[p]The adolescent stage, which spans roughly from age 10 to 30, is marked by intense neurological and Koric development. The Lokraasos begin to display an acute sensitivity to emotion, atmosphere, and arcane energy. During this phase, many experience what are known as \"sky-dreams\" — half-prophetic visions brought on by high-altitude trance flight. It is also during this time that their wings reach full span.[/p]\r\n[p]Adulthood begins between ages 30 and 35, when their flame stabilizes and physical development plateaus. A mature Lokraasos possesses near-perfect spatial orientation, full mastery of aerial movement, and the mental discipline required for her spiritual role. Unlike most species, Lokraasos continue to sharpen cognitively well into their second century, reaching peak clarity and influence between ages 60 and 100.[/p]\r\n[p]A Lokraasos does not visibly age until her final decades. Deterioration is graceful and slow: wing membranes lose some translucence, hair stiffens, and the voice deepens to a resonant, ember-rich timbre. Most live around 180 years, though some have endured longer — fading not from frailty, but from silence, vanishing into high places as the sky calls them home.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]\r\n[p][/p]",

    "averageIntelligence": "[p]Lokraasos possess extraordinary intelligence, with cognitive capacity rivalling or surpassing most sapient species of Nixxia. Their minds are marked by rapid spatial reasoning, layered memory, and an intuitive grasp of symbolism and language — particularly where magic and prophecy are concerned. They are contemplative by nature and capable of deep philosophical abstraction, often seeing patterns or meaning in events long before others can grasp their significance.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]",
    "averagePhysique": "[p]Sleek yet powerful, Lokraasos bodies are built for aerial dominance. They average 1.9 meters in height and exhibit remarkable muscular definition, particularly across the shoulders, chest, and legs — areas essential to flight. Though leaner than most Saarotsos, they display superior endurance, explosive agility, and exceptional coordination, enabling them to navigate both open skies and dense terrain with lethal grace.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]",
    "facialCharacteristics": "[p]Lokraasos faces are surprisingly more human-like than those of their Dovagoraan kin, a feature that lends them an eerie familiarity despite their otherwise draconic form. They are sharply defined, with high cheekbones, narrow jaws, and smooth, obsidian-toned skin. Their eyes are almond-shaped and glow faintly from within, often colored in hues of molten copper, deep crimson, or gold. Thin, slitted pupils adjust fluidly between glaring daylight and starlit shadow. Their expressions are typically serene, though when angered or inspired, their faces blaze with almost supernatural intensity. No facial hair grows among them, and their mouths, though humanoid in structure, conceal pointed teeth — a remnant of their draconic ancestry.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]",
    "skinHairColor": "[p]The skin of a Lokraasos bears a dark, metallic luster — often shades of blackened bronze, smoldering ash, or burnished obsidian. Subtle iridescence shimmers beneath the scales, catching flame or starlight in spectral hues. Along the limbs and back, faint markings sometimes emerge over time — silvery or copper-toned tracings that resemble script or arcane veins, thought by some to reflect the movement of Kori within. Their wings share this coloration, with membranes that shift in shade depending on light and emotional state.[/p]\r\n[p][/p]",

    "relationshipsIdeals": "[p]Relationships, when they occur, are private, solemn affairs rooted in trust and respect rather than passion or legacy.

As the only winged Dovagoraan, they cannot be mistaken for any other, making such deceit not merely a falsehood, but a desecration. Likewise, touching a Lokraasos’ wings without permission is viewed as a grave violation.
